# MOVIES

This is a brief exploration of the Rotten Tomatoes API, started at PennApps and
cleaned up for use on [my blog](http://admissions.tufts.edu/blogs/jumbo-talk/author/marcella-hastings/).

## To Run
If you have a computer with a built-in terminal (ie you're running Mac or Linux)
this should work. You'll need to [register an API
key](http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/) and replace the right
side of the '=' on line 10 with it.

1. Open a Terminal
2. [Install git](http://git-scm.com/download/mac) if you don't have it.
3. Type this command:
       git clone https://github.com/marsella/movies.git
4. Type
       cd movies
       python tomato.py
5. ???
6. Profit
